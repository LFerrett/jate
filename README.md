# JATE: Just Another Text Editor

## Description

JATE is a PWA that runs in a browser, allowing a user to create simple notes or code snippets. The single page app features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

## Installation

This api can be tested used locally on your machine by cloning the repo. Then in the command line use ```npm i``` to install dependencies and ```npm start``` to get the app to work on your local host. It can later be installed from your browser. 

For a live test of the app, go to the heroku deployed link at: https://shrouded-bayou-25852.herokuapp.com/

## User Story
